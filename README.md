tutorial on hosting a server: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQbfDYAfqz8 (watch this if you don't know what you're doing)

# Instructions

PRE-BUILD DLLS ARE IN THE /dlls FOLDER!

## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition [Download here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/)

## Compilation
1. Open `dllmain.cpp` with Visual Studio.
2. Build the solution.
3. Copy the DLL from `server-code\x64\Release`.

## Hosting a Local Server
To host a local server, follow these steps:

1. open Rumbleverse
2. download a dll injector (this one works good: https://github.com/nefarius/Injector)
3. open terminal in the directory where your dll that you want to inject is located, use `Injector.exe --process-name RumbleverseClient-Win64-Shipping.exe --inject C:\path\to\your.dll`

You may need to relaunch it a few times as this version is unstable. Once your console displays "Listening" in white text, the server is ready to join. 
(to start rumbleverse with it's console run `start /b "" RumbleverseClient-Win64-Shipping.exe" "-log"`)

## Joining the Server Locally
To join locally:

1. Open a new session of Rumbleverse.
2. Inject with UUU.
3. Open the console and paste `open 127.0.0.1:62169`.
To join over the internet open your port (tutorial: https://portforward.com)

## Changing Game Modes
To change game modes:

1. Open `dllmain.cpp` and go to line 32.
2. Change EGameMode global_mode = EGameMode::PLAYGROUND; to your desired mode.
3. Valid formats for game modes are:
   - FREE_ROAM
   - PLAYGROUND
   - BR_SOLOS
   - BR_DUOS
   - BR_TRIOS
   - BR_QUADS

Compile the solution and repeat the steps above.
